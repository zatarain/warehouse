# Warehouse
This project aims to be an exercise to discuss about software engineering technical topics like system design, testing, deployment, etcetera.

## Overview
This simple application aims to manage a warehouse to hold articles, and the articles should contain an identification number, a name and available stock.

The warehouse application will also have to manage products. Products are made of different articles. Products should have a name, price and a list of articles of which they are made from with a quantity.

The data source for both (products and articles) will be text files in JSON format.

## Tenets
The primary values for the implementation will be: simplicity, readability, maintainability, testability. It should be easy to scan the code and rather quickly understand what itâ€™s doing.

### Scope
* Load the data from the JSON files.
* Write the results on the JSON files.
* Validate user input and data in the files.
* Show the output to the user in JSON format.

### Assumptions
* The application is not thread-safe.
* The files are locally stored in specific folder with the specific provided names.
* Since the data is on text files, we won't any implement transactional or ACID model.
* Text files are well formed and has specific format.
* Data in the text files is consistent as described below in **Data** subsection.
* Encoding for the files will be assumed as UTF8.

# Design
Following subsections aim to briefly describe the desing of the solution, description of the data, the interactions with the user and expected behaviours.

## Workflows
The warehouse application will work in following way:
1. Load the data from the files at the start of the application.
2. Sequentially allow the user request following operations:
    * List all products and their availability based on the current inventory.
    * Sell a product and update the correspondent articles.
    * Show the help for the application.
    * Exit from the application.

### Load data
**Input:** None
1. For each of the data files (products and inventory):
    1. Open the file
    2. Parse the JSON file
    3. Strucuture the data for convinient access
2. Make the link/join between products and articles.
3. Compute the initial availability for all the products.

### List all products
**Input:** None

**Steps:**
1. For each product:
   1. Print its name and availability

### Sell a product
**Input:** Product name

**Steps:**
1. Validate the user input.
2. If it's invalid, show an error message and end this workflow.
3. Look for the product on the loaded data.
4. If the product exists:
    1. Check its availability, if it's available:
        1. Display list of articles (names) and amounts
	    2. Update the inventory of articles
	    3. Update the availability only for the impacted producs
    2. Otherwise: tell to the user that product is unavailaible.
5. Otherwise: tell to the user product doesn't exist.

### Show help
**Input:** None

**Steps:**
1. Show brief description of the available operations with their expected input and output.

### Exit
**Input:** None

**Steps:**
1. Write the data on the correspondent files.
2. Close the files properly.
3. Terminate the application.

## Data
Taking following JSON files as examples, we can see that all the entries in their are either strings, list or objects:

**inventory.json:**
```json
{
  "inventory": [
    {
      "art_id": "1",
      "name": "leg",
      "stock": "12"
    },
    {
      "art_id": "2",
      "name": "screw",
      "stock": "17"
    }
  ]
}
```

**products.json:**
```json
{
  "products": [
    {
      "name": "Dining Chair",
      "contain_articles": [
        {
          "art_id": "1",
          "amount_of": "4"
        },
        {
          "art_id": "2",
          "amount_of": "8"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

So, we need to parse the data to a convinient structure in memory, for instance: numbers to a proper integral data type. We will call those structures: models.

### Models
Models are a collection of labeled fields and will read and parse the data from the files and put it in a memory dataset which will be a collection of records indexed by a *primary key*. The models will be also able to write the data in the files. We will use following structure and data types to model the data on the files:

From file *inventory.json* each **article** will have following fields:
|Field name |Data type| JSON key |
|:---       |  :---:  | :---     |
|*id*       | integer | `art_id` |
|name       | string  | `name`   |
|stock      | integer | `stock`  |

From file *products.json* each **product** will have following fields:
|Field name |Data type| JSON key          |
|:---       |  :---:  | :---              |
|*name*     | string  | `name`            |
|articles   |   map   | `contain_articles`|

The mapping for the articles will be a collection of pairs from integer (`art_id`) to integer (`amount_of`).

#### Consistency assumptions
* Each file has a main entry (`inventory` or `products`) which is a list.
* Article IDs are unique and won't change.
* All the integers on the file are actually strings.
* Product names are unique, case sensitive and won't change.
* The articles are not duplicated in the same product.
* All the integers on the file are actually strings.

#### Data relationships
We can see from the sample files that the relationship between products and articles is a many-to-many relationship (`N:M`). So, this implies that we need to take care of both when we update any instance of any entity in order to keep the data integrity.
